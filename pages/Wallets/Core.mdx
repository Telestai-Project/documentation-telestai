## **Security and Considerations**
- **Full Control:** The core wallet gives you full control of your funds but requires more maintenance and disk space.
- **Private Key Management:** Keys are stored locally and never exposed to the internet, making it highly secure.
- **Longer Sync Times:** Since it downloads the full blockchain, syncing can be resource-intensive.
- **Ideal Use Case:** Recommended for advanced users, developers, or those seeking the highest level of security.
