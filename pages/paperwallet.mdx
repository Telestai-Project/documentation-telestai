# üîê Telestai Paper Wallet

The [Telestai Paper Wallet](https://paperwallet.telestai.io/) is a secure and offline method for generating and storing your Telestai (TLS) private and public keys. By keeping your keys completely offline, it provides one of the safest ways to hold your TLS, protecting your assets from online hacking attempts.

## What is a Paper Wallet?

A paper wallet is a physical document containing your public and private keys. The keys are generated entirely offline, providing an extra layer of security by keeping them away from the internet. This makes a paper wallet ideal for long-term storage of TLS funds or for users who want the highest level of security.

## Why Use a Paper Wallet?

- **Offline Security**: Your private key is never exposed to the internet, significantly reducing the risk of hacks or data breaches.
- **Physical Backup**: A printed wallet can be stored safely, much like other important documents, ensuring that you retain access to your TLS funds without depending on digital devices.
- **No Third-Party Dependence**: You generate and hold your keys yourself, meaning you don't need to trust any third-party service to store your funds.

## How It Works

1. A unique Telestai public and private key pair is generated securely.
2. The keys are displayed as both text and QR codes, making them easy to use.
3. Once printed, the paper wallet can be stored safely, ensuring your funds are secure as long as the wallet is kept private.

## Important Security Tips

- **Keep It Safe**: Store your paper wallet in a secure location, like a safe or safety deposit box. Treat it as you would cash or other valuable assets.
- **Consider Backups**: For added security, consider creating multiple copies of your paper wallet and storing them in different secure locations.
- **Protect from Damage**: Laminating the paper wallet can help protect it from physical damage, such as water or wear over time.

## How to Use Your Paper Wallet

Once your paper wallet is created, you can use the public key to receive TLS funds. To check the balance or send funds, you will need to import the private key into a Telestai-supported wallet, such as **telestai-qt** or **telestai-cli**.

- **Public Key**: Share this with others to receive TLS.
- **Private Key**: Keep this key secure and private. Anyone with access to your private key can control your funds.
