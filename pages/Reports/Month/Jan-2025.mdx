# **Telestai January 2025 Report**

## **Key Updates and Progress**

### **1. Building From the Ground Up**
2024 was a time of experimentation, but 2025 is about solidifying our foundation. We’re taking a comprehensive, ground-up approach to development, ensuring that everything we build aligns with our long-term vision for Telestai. This includes:
- Developing critical **NPM packages** to empower developers.
- Prioritizing ease of use for **web development within UTXO-based chains**, an area traditionally underserved compared to Ethereum or Solana ecosystems.

Our goal is to replicate the seamless user experience seen in those ecosystems, where complex backend processes are abstracted for developers and users alike. This vision will allow broader utilities to flourish within the Telestai ecosystem.

### **2. Zeroa: A Key Pillar for Connectivity**
Zeroa remains at the heart of our ecosystem, and **v2** marks a significant leap forward:
- **Simplified User Experience**: Zeroa v2 will make it effortless to authenticate with platforms like **Lascaux** and, eventually, **Mercatus**.
- **Browser Support Expansion**: We’re actively working to support not only **Brave** and **Chrome** but also **Microsoft Edge** and **Firefox**, ensuring broader accessibility.
- **Enhanced Interconnectivity**: Zeroa is being rebuilt from the ground up to integrate deeply with Telestai’s ecosystem, serving as a seamless bridge between users, their data, and Telestai’s platforms.

While we’re finalizing features, Zeroa v2 is poised to be the foundation for the “new wave” versions of our platforms.

### **3. Lascaux: Challenges in Decentralized Governance**
Lascaux has been an incredible learning experience, giving us valuable insight into the challenges of balancing decentralization with moderation. As a decentralized social media platform, it must:
- Promote meaningful and **beneficial content** without falling into the traps of unchecked toxicity.
- Define a framework for **moderation** that aligns with the principles of decentralization while protecting against harmful content.

At this stage, development is intentionally paused while we rethink how Lascaux and our other platforms, such as Zeroa, can evolve. The prototypes from 2024 have been instrumental in understanding data schemas, governance mechanisms, and potential content policies. This will inform the next iteration of the platform, ensuring it’s both scalable and impactful.

### **4. Telestai Creator Bubble OS**
Development on the **Telestai Creator Bubble OS** is advancing rapidly. Recent progress includes:
- Integration of the **Telestai Electrum Wallet** for secure, lightweight transactions.
- Comprehensive access to Telestai tools, such as Lascaux and the web wallet.
- Completion of the Telestai-CB documentation, with minor updates planned in the coming weeks.
- Security enhancements and repository setup for streamlined updates.

We anticipate a **January 2025 release** for the first stable version, bringing a privacy-focused, creator-centric OS to the ecosystem.

### **5. Telestai Dashboard: A Hub for Connectivity**
One of our most exciting developments is the **Telestai Dashboard**, a central hub designed to connect and integrate all Telestai applications. The dashboard will:
- Provide access to **global mining stats** and **price statistics** for Telestai.
- Serve as a launchpad for Telestai applications such as **Lascaux**, **Mercatus**, and others.
- Offer a unified interface for interacting with the ecosystem, ensuring everything feels interconnected.
- Simplify navigation and improve the user experience, making Telestai more accessible than ever.

This dashboard represents our commitment to creating a seamless, connected experience for all users.

### **6. Mercatus: Ethical Data Transparency**
Mercatus continues to represent our vision for user-driven data sharing. While in its early stages, we’re laying the groundwork for features like:
- **Zeroa Integration**: Enabling users to securely manage data sharing via the Zeroa extension.
- **Future Monetization Models**: Exploring ways to reward users for optional data sharing, providing ethical alternatives to traditional advertising platforms.
