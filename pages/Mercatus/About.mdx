# Mercatus Streaming System Documentation

Welcome to **Mercatus**, a streaming system powered by Telestai. This platform is designed for transparency and experimentation, enabling users to contribute data for insights within the Telestai ecosystem.

## Live Dashboard

You can access your dashboard at:

[https://mercatus.telestai.io/](https://mercatus.telestai.io/)

The frontend, built with **Next.js**, displays personalized metrics based on your data submissions. The backend, written in **Python**, powers the Kafka producer, manages the data pipeline, and securely aggregates data.

## Telestai Chrome Extension

To participate in data streaming, download the latest **Telestai Chrome Extension**:

[Telestai Chrome Extension v1.0.1](https://github.com/Telestai-Project/telestai-chrome-extension/releases/tag/mercatus-1.0.1)

### What's New in v1.0.1
- **Dashboard Access**: Streamed data is no longer public. Instead, users can use their **Zeroa address** to view personalized metrics.
- **Enhanced Privacy**: URLs and time spent are tracked but no longer publicly visible. Data is securely aggregated.
- **Improved UI**: Mercatus now features a streamlined and modernized user interface that aligns more closely with our vision.

## What Happens When You Opt-In?

### Data Being Streamed
When you opt into streaming:
- **Base URLs** (e.g., `google.com`) are shared.
- **Time spent** on each tab is included.

### No Other Information Collected
- No private or sensitive data is collected.
- The system securely aggregates the **total data submitted** and **cumulative time spent** per user, that's the only information stored.

### Data Availability
- Data is **not available to the general public**. 
- During this testnet phase, the **Telestai team** may access this data to evaluate system performance and user contributions.
- As marketing partnerships evolve, data may be shared with partners who engage in formal and transparent agreements with Telestai. Users will always retain control over participation.

## Transparency and User Control

### Mercatus Dashboard
Your dashboard is accessible using your **Zeroa address**. It displays:
- The **total data submitted**.
- The **cumulative time spent** across all tabs.

### User Security
We prioritize your security and privacy:
- You are in **complete control** of enabling or disabling streaming.
- The system does not store or stream sensitive or identifiable information.

## Technical Overview

The Mercatus Streaming System is built using:
- **Kafka** for real-time data streaming and aggregation.
- **PostgreSQL** for secure and scalable data storage.
- **Docker** for efficient containerization of services.
- **Python** for backend logic and data processing.
- **Next.js** for a modern, responsive frontend experience.

---

## Purpose and Vision

Mercatus is still in **testnet status**, allowing us to experiment and improve before a full production release. Our goals include:
- Building a transparent, user-driven platform for streaming data.
- Enabling integrations with **marketing agencies** and other data-driven organizations.
- Rewarding users based on their data contributions.

## Important Disclaimer

By opting into data streaming:
1. Your shared data is securely aggregated(time spent and total data submitted).
2. Data is not available to the general public, but the **Telestai team** may access it during this phase to improve the system.
3. The system focuses on **streaming and aggregation only**â€”data is not shared or sold at this stage unless formal and transparent partnerships are pursued.

We encourage all users to review and understand these updates before opting in.
