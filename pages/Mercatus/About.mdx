# Mercatus Streaming System Documentation

Welcome to **Mercatus**, a streaming system powered by Telestai. This is a public data streaming platform designed for transparency and experimentation within the Telestai ecosystem.

## Live Dashboard

You can view the live stream of submitted data at:

[https://mercatus.telestai.io/](https://mercatus.telestai.io/)

The frontend, built with **Next.js**, acts as a Kafka consumer and displays live updates of streaming data in real-time. The backend, written in **Python**, powers the Kafka producer and manages the data pipeline.

## Telestai Chrome Extension

To participate in data streaming, you can download the **Telestai Chrome Extension**:

[Telestai Chrome Extension v1.0.0](https://github.com/Telestai-Project/telestai-chrome-extension/releases/tag/mercatus-1.0.0)

The extension allows you to **opt-in** to data streaming. By enabling streaming, you actively share specific data with the Mercatus platform.

---

## What Happens When You Opt-In?

### Data Being Streamed
When you opt into streaming:
- **Base URLs** (e.g., `google.com`) are shared.
- **Time spent** on each tab is included.

### No Other Information Collected
- No private or sensitive data is collected.
- The system **does not store data**â€”it leverages streaming only.

---

## Transparency and User Control

### Live Data Visibility
All streamed data is visible to anyone accessing the live dashboard at [https://mercatus.telestai.io/](https://mercatus.telestai.io/). This transparency is intentional to help users understand what data is being shared.

### User Security
User security is paramount. We emphasize:
- You are in **complete control** of enabling or disabling streaming.
- The system does not track private information or store any data beyond the live streaming session.

---

## Technical Overview

The Mercatus Streaming System is built using:
- **Kafka** for real-time data streaming.
- **Docker** for efficient containerization of services.
- **Python** for backend logic and Kafka producer/consumer integration.
- **Next.js** for the frontend live dashboard.

---

## Purpose and Vision

This release is a **basic preview** designed for early adopters and enthusiasts within the Telestai ecosystem. It demonstrates:
- The potential of data streaming in a transparent environment.
- A foundation for future integrations with **marketing agencies** and other participating parties.

---

## Important Disclaimer

By opting into data streaming:
1. Your shared data will be publicly visible to anyone using the Mercatus frontend.
2. The current implementation is experimental and focuses on **streaming only**, not storage.

We encourage all users to understand the implications of data streaming before opting in.
