# Telestai Marketing Beta

The Telestai Marketing Beta is an experimental system designed to engage users on social media and grow our decentralized community. The goal is simple: reward users for interacting with Telestai content on X (formerly Twitter) by offering Telestai coins (TLS) as incentives.

## How It Works

1. **Join the Telestai Discord Server**: Enroll by adding your Twitter username through our custom Discord bot.
2. **Identity Verification**: The bot verifies your identity and checks if you have performed actions on relevant X posts.
3. **Claim Rewards**: Click the verify button in Discord to claim your reward for each post.
4. **Withdraw Points**: Users can withdraw their points to a TLS wallet address at any time.

## System Overview

- **Post Detection**: The system checks for new posts every 15 minutes. When a post is found, users are notified via Discord.
- **Validation**: The bot verifies user actions on X posts and checks for valid interactions.
- **Rewards Distribution**: Upon verification, users can claim their rewards through the Discord bot.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are logged publicly via the Telestai block explorer.

This system is in its experimental phase, and we're testing its impact on social media engagement. The goal is to build a stronger community while rewarding active participants.
