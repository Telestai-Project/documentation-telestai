### Mining Rewards and Developer Fee

At Telestai, coins are created through the act of mining. Mining is a rewarded activity as it involves the use of various resources, including computational power and energy.

#### Developer Fee

We apply a **25% developer fee** on all mining rewards. This means that 25% of the mined coins are allocated to the developer's wallet.

#### Why a Developer Fee?

The developer fee is not just a reward for our hardworking team of developers but also a key resource for driving community engagement and rewarding contributors. Our team has been working tirelessly, delivering significant outputs within a short timeframe. We have big goals for Telestai, and with those goals come long hours and dedication from our developers to ensure the project’s success. We believe it's important to reward their efforts while also supporting the broader community.

#### Utilizing the Developer Fee

1. **Engagement Mining**: We want to use part of the developer fee to reward users who engage with our X account. By participating in **engagement mining**, users can earn rewards for helping to spread the word about Telestai.

2. **Community Contributions**: We also plan to reward community members who contribute to Telestai’s success in areas such as development, marketing, and other sectors. These individuals play a crucial role in making Telestai what it is today, and we want to show our appreciation for their efforts.

#### Transparency

The developer wallet is public, ensuring full transparency. You can check the developer wallet balance and transactions here:
