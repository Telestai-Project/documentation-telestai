# Zeroa Password Manager

**Zeroa** is an **open-source** project that explores how blockchain technology can rethink password management. It leverages **BIP-39 seed phrases**‚Äîthe same secure phrases used by blockchain wallets‚Äîto encrypt and decrypt password vaults, giving users the power of **self-sovereign identity** and **decentralized security**.

---

## üöß Alpha Status - Work in Progress

Zeroa is in its **alpha phase** and **not production-ready**. The current features are functional, but significant development is still underway. We encourage **crypto developers, security enthusiasts, and the blockchain community** to contribute and help us evolve this project.

---

## üí° Current Features

- **BIP-39 Encryption**: Zeroa allows you to encrypt your password vault using any **BIP-39** compatible seed phrase (such as those used in Bitcoin or Ethereum wallets).
- **Simple and Local**: Passwords are stored securely on your device with strong encryption.
- **Minimal Interface**: Clean, user-friendly UI that lets you add, view, and delete passwords.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Zeroa brings a blockchain-first approach to password management, built for crypto enthusiasts and developers.
- **Open-Source**: Contributions are welcome to help improve and expand the tool.

### üîú Upcoming Features:
- **Cross-Device Password Recovery**: Work is being done to enable users to recover their encrypted password vault across multiple devices using the same seed phrase. This will enhance usability while maintaining decentralized control.
- **Web3 Authentication**: As Zeroa matures, the goal is to enable **web3-based authentication**, where your BIP-39 seed phrase will be used for secure sign-ins across various platforms‚Äîwithout the need for multiple passwords.

## üîß Installation & Setup

To try Zeroa locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Telestai-Project/zeroa-password-manager.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd zeroa-password-manager

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python3 gui.py
```

### Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **BIP-39** (via `bip-utils`)
- **Tkinter** (for the GUI)
- **pycryptodome** (for AES encryption)

> **Important**: This is alpha software and should not be used for storing critical passwords at this stage.
