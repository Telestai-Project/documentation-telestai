# Voting

This document explains how **voting works** in Lasko. Voting is a key feature that allows users to **interact with posts and influence content visibility** through upvotes and downvotes. All voting actions are tied to a user's **Telestai wallet address** via blockchain-based authentication. This ensures transparency and accountability in all interactions.

## **How Voting Works**

### 1. **Casting a Vote**

- **Users must be authenticated** through their wallet before voting.
- A user can either **upvote (positive value)** or **downvote (negative value)** a post. The system enforces **one vote per post per user**.
- If a user tries to vote again, the system will **toggle their existing vote**:
  - If a vote already exists, it is **removed**, and the vote value is **adjusted to 0**.
  - If no vote exists, a **new vote is recorded** with the provided value.

### 2. **Vote Threshold and Post Removal**

- Posts have a **vote threshold** set at **-20**.  
- If a post’s total vote value drops to **-20 or lower**, the post is **automatically removed** from the platform. This ensures that low-quality or inappropriate content is filtered out by the community.

### 3. **How the Voting API Works**

- **Vote Creation**: When a user votes on a post, the system checks if they have **already voted**:
  - If a vote exists, it is **deleted**.
  - If no vote exists, a **new vote** is created with the specified value.
  
- **Fetching Vote Data**:
  - Users can **view their own votes** on specific posts through the API.
  - The total votes for each post are **aggregated and displayed** in real time.
  
- **Deleting a Vote**: Users can **remove their votes** if they no longer want to participate in the voting for a post.
