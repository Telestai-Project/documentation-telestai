# **Lasko Improvement Proposal (LIP-001)**

**Title:** Verified Author System, Backend Security Enhancements & AI Moderation Migration  
**Version:** 4.0.0  
**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress   
**Author:** Zach Price  
**Created:** Feb 3 2025  
**Target Release:** Lasko v4.0.0

## **Summary**

This proposal outlines the transition from the name **Lasko to Lasko**, introduces a **Verified Author System** to improve content quality and security, and strengthens backend infrastructure by **dockerizing the backend** while restricting database access to internal requests. Additionally, this proposal includes migrating AI moderation to **Flux** for further decentralization and updating the **Lasko branding with a new logo**.

## **Objectives**

1. **Implement a Verified Author System** to prevent spam & elevate content quality.
2. **Ensure backend security** by restricting direct Cassandra DB access.
3. **Leverage Telestai-message** for cryptographic signing & verification.
4. **Rebrand Lasko to Lasko** as part of the v4.0.0 release. ðŸŸ¡
5. **Migrate AI moderation provider to Flux** to decentralize moderation services. âœ…
6. **Update Lasko branding** with a new logo reflecting the new identity. ðŸŸ¡

## **ðŸ“Œ Verified Author System**

### **How It Works**

- All users can sign into Lasko, read posts, and vote, but only approved **Verified Authors** can create new posts.
- Node operators can **choose to accept**:
    - **Verified Authors (default)** â€“ Pulled from a community-approved list.
    - **Custom Author List** â€“ Operators can manually approve specific public keys (Telestai Addresses).

### **Governance & Onboarding**

- The system will operate similarly to `Lasko-nodes`, where authors **submit a PR request** to add their address as our early POC with plans to elaborate on this system later on for broader community accessibility and support.
- Community **reviews and approves** author requests.
- A **verified icon** will appear next to usernames for approved authors.

### **Reporting & Content Moderation**

- If a post is flagged **5 times**, the authorâ€™s public key will be **temporarily suspended**.
- The flagged metric might scale, i.e., if 200 people in the node, an X % would be required. Outside of scope for 4.0.0 though, can be implemented and perfected in the next sprint.
- A governance appeal process will allow authors to **regain posting privileges**.

---

## **ðŸ”’ Backend Security & Infrastructure**

- **Dockerizing the backend** ensures Lasko nodes are easy to deploy securely.
- **Cassandra DB will no longer be exposed** to the global internetâ€”only FastAPI will be publicly accessible.
- **Post verification** will require a **Telestai-signed message**, ensuring only properly signed posts enter the database.

---

## **ðŸ¤– AI Moderation Migration to Flux**

- Current AI moderation system relies on centralized services.
- Lasko v4.0.0 will **integrate Flux as the primary AI moderation provider**, allowing for **decentralized content filtering**.
- This enhances **censorship resistance** and **ensures the moderation process is distributed** across multiple independent nodes.

---

## **ðŸŽ¨ Branding & Logo Update**

- As part of the **Lasko rebranding**, a **new logo** will be introduced.
- The logo will reflect the **new decentralized-first vision** of Lasko and align with Telestaiâ€™s broader ecosystem aesthetics.

---

## **ðŸ›  Implementation & Dependencies**

- **Frontend:** Will display the **Verified Author badge**, integrate Flux moderation, and update branding.
- **Backend:**
    - Update FastAPI layer to **verify signed messages** before adding posts.
    - Integrate a **Telestai-message Python implementation** to verify cryptographic signatures.
    - Fully dockerize the backend with proper security configurations.
    - Implement **Flux-based AI moderation** as the primary moderation engine.

---

## **ðŸš€ Goals & Future Expansion**

- **Prevent spam & abuse** while keeping the system **decentralized & scalable**.
- **Encourage high-quality content** by establishing a **trusted author network**.
- **Provide a sustainable on-ramp for new creators** to enter the ecosystem.
- **Leverage AI moderation on a decentralized network** for content filtering.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Develop **Python-based message verification** for Telestai-message.
2. Create Github Repo for onboarding creators via Pull Request.
3. Implement **frontend UI updates**, including Verified Badges and Flux integration.
4. **Dockerize Lasko backend** and restrict DB access.
5. **Update Lasko branding & logo**.

---

### **Final Notes**

Lasko v4.0.0 will be a **major milestone** in ensuring **secure, high-quality content** while maintaining **decentralized principles**. By incorporating **Flux moderation, a Verified Author system, and security enhancements**, this update will **strengthen Laskoâ€™s position as a leading decentralized content platform**.
