## **How JWT Authentication Works**

- **JWT Tokens with Wallet Addresses**:  
  When you log in, Lascaux generates a **JWT token** with your **wallet address embedded**. This ensures that all posts, comments, and votes are **tied to your verified wallet identity**.

- **Session Management**:  
  Your JWT token is stored in **localStorage**, ensuring seamless access to the platform. When interacting with Lascaux, the platform knows who posted, commented, or voted.

---

## **Security and Best Practices**

- **Blockchain-Based Authentication**: Lascaux eliminates traditional passwords, using **signed messages** for secure login.
- **BIP39 Seed Phrase**: Your wallet is secured with a **BIP39 master password (seed phrase)**. Keep this phrase safe—it is the only way to recover your wallet if lost.
- **Use of JWT Tokens**: JWT tokens provide a **transparent and accountable way** to track user interactions while maintaining decentralization.
