# Lascaux Backend System Documentation

## Overview

Lascaux's backend is designed to be decentralized, allowing community members to run their own nodes. In this early **testnet version**, we are testing several key components to ensure they work smoothly under load. This guide provides insights into how the backend operates and how each module functions. 

In Testnet v2, **FastAPI** serves as the API framework, and **Cassandra** provides the database, enabling node-based data replication across multiple instances. This documentation will walk through the architecture, key files, and the installation process to get the backend running on your own node.

## Key Backend Components

### **Auth Module (`auth.py`)**
The `auth.py` file handles **user authentication** and **sign-ups** using wallet-based identity. Each user registers with their **wallet address**, which acts as a unique identifier.

#### Key Features:
- **JWT-based Authentication**: After sign-up or login, the user receives a JWT access token, which is required for subsequent requests.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses the `.env` file to manage sensitive keys (like the JWT `SECRET_KEY`).
- **Duplicate Checks**: Ensures that both wallet addresses and display names are unique before creating a new user.

**Endpoints:**
- **POST /auth/signup**: Create a new user with wallet authentication.
- **POST /auth/signin**: Issue a JWT token for a returning user.
- **GET /auth/verify-token**: Verify a JWT token

### **Post Module (`post.py`)**
The `post.py` file manages **user-generated content** (posts) and ensures that only highly-rated content stays visible.

#### Key Features:
- **Voting Thresholds**: Posts that receive votes below the threshold (`VOTE_THRESHOLD = -20`) are automatically removed.
- **Logging**: Each action, like post creation and deletion, is logged for easy tracking.
- **Pagination**: Supports pagination to handle large volumes of posts.

**Endpoints:**
- **GET /posts**: Retrieve all posts (with pagination).
- **POST /posts**: Create a new post.
- **POST /posts/create_post**: Create a new post (requires JWT token).
- **GET `/posts/{post_id}`**: Retrieve a specific post by ID.
- **PUT `/posts/{post_id}`**: Update an existing post.
- **DELETE `/posts/{post_id}`**: Delete a post by ID.

---

### **Vote Module (`vote.py`)**
The `vote.py` module handles **voting mechanics**, allowing users to upvote or downvote posts.

#### Key Features:
- **Toggle Voting**: Users can toggle their vote on a post, either adding a new vote or removing an existing one.
- **Vote Aggregation**: The total vote value for a post is calculated by summing individual vote values.
- **User-Specific Voting**: Users can check their specific vote on a post.

**Endpoints:**
- **POST `/votes`**: Allows a user to toggle their vote on a post. If a vote already exists, it is removed; otherwise, a new vote is created.
- **GET `/votes/{vote_id}`**: Retrieves a specific vote by its ID. If the vote does not exist, a 404 error is returned.
- **GET `/post/{post_id}/votes`**: Calculates and returns the total vote value for a specific post by summing all votes.
- **GET `/post/{post_id}/user-vote`**: Retrieves the current user's vote value on a specific post. If no vote is found, it returns a vote value of 0.
- **DELETE `/votes/{vote_id}`**: Deletes a vote by its ID. If the vote does not exist, a 404 error is returned.

## Database System: Cassandra

Cassandra is a **distributed NoSQL database** known for its high availability, horizontal scalability, and fault tolerance. In the Lascaux backend, **Cassandra** stores user profiles, posts, and votes, with **data replicated across nodes** to ensure reliability.

### Key Features of Cassandra:
- **Decentralization**: Perfect for systems like Lascaux where multiple nodes store and serve data independently.
- **Replication Across Nodes**: Each node stores a copy of the data, making it resilient to node failures.
- **High Throughput**: Designed to handle high volumes of reads and writes, making it ideal for social media platforms.

### Cassandraâ€™s Role in Lascaux:
- Each community node runs its own instance of Cassandra.
- Data is **replicated across nodes** to ensure consistency and prevent data loss.
- When a post or vote is created on one node, it can be propagated to others.

**Note**: It is important to **wait until the Cassandra database is fully initialized** before running the backend system.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Lascaux backend on your own node:

Note: You'll need to have Docker installed to run Lascaux Backend.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Telestai-Project/lascaux-backend.git
cd lascaux-backend
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher). Then, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Start the Cassandra Database**
You must have Cassandra installed. Run the following command to start Cassandra:
```bash
python start_cassandra.py
```
> **Note**: It may take some time for the Cassandra instance to fully initialize. Wait until it is ready before starting the backend.

### 4. **Run the FastAPI Backend**
Once Cassandra is up and running, start the backend using Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Example Usage

- **Healthcheck**: Verify the backend is running:
  ```
  GET /healthcheck
  ```
  **Response:**
  ```json
  { "status": "ok" }
  ```

- **Create a User**:
  ```
  POST /auth/signup
  {
    "wallet_address": "your_wallet_address",
    "display_name": "your_display_name",
    "bio": "This is my bio"
  }
  ```

## Summary

This version of Lascaux is an **early testnet release**, designed to ensure that the backend system is functional and stable. The combination of **FastAPI with Uvicorn** and **Cassandra as the database** provides the scalability needed for a distributed system. 

We encourage the community to explore the system, report issues, and suggest improvements. This feedback will be invaluable as we move toward the next iterations and future releases.
