# **Lascaux Node Setup Guide (v3)**

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up a **Lascaux v3 Node**. Running a node helps decentralize the Lascaux platform and participate in the testnet. Nodes host a **database and API** and are designed to be lightweight, independent, and easy to set up. 

Nodes do **not need to sync** at this time, and they **do not yet assist with AI moderation**, making high availability unnecessary. However, your contribution helps pave the way for future updates, including incentives for node operators.

## **Why Run a Lascaux Node?**

1. **Lightweight Design**: Only a few CPU cores and a few GB of RAM are needed.
2. **Independent Operation**: Nodes run independently, with no syncing required.
3. **Community Contribution**: Decentralize the platform and prepare for future features.
4. **Future Incentives**: Potential TLS rewards based on node usage.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher.
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Docker**: Required to run the Cassandra database. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Make Utility**: For streamlined commands.
- **Ports Open**:
  - **Port 80**: For HTTP traffic.
  - **Port 443**: For HTTPS traffic (Certbot requirement).
- **Router Access**: For port forwarding if required.

---

## **Installation**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Telestai-Project/lascaux-backend.git
cd lascaux-backend
git checkout v3.0.0
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following `make` command to install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
make install
```

---

### 3. Run the FastAPI Backend

Start the backend using the following command(This will start the backend and the Cassandra database):

```bash
make run_app
```

The backend will be accessible at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**.

## **Setting Up Nginx for Public Access**

To make your node accessible over HTTPS, configure Nginx as a reverse proxy.

### Step 1: Install Nginx and Certbot

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Nginx

Create a new Nginx configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/lascaux-node.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomainhere.com;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomainhere.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomainhere.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomainhere.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Enable Nginx Configuration

Link the configuration file to the enabled sites directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/lascaux-node.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### Step 4: Set Up SSL with Certbot

Run Certbot to configure SSL:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomainhere.com
```

---

## **Port Forwarding**

If your node is behind a router, forward the following ports to your server:
- **Port 80**: For HTTP traffic and Certbot validation.
- **Port 443**: For HTTPS traffic.

---

## **Submit Your Node**

To get your node listed on the [Lascaux platform](https://lascaux.telestai.io):

1. Ensure your node is running and accessible at `/healthcheck`. Verify with:

   ```bash
   curl https://yourdomainhere.com/healthcheck
   ```

   A successful response will look like:

   ```json
   { "status": "ok" }
   ```

2. Submit a pull request to the [Lascaux Nodes Repository](https://github.com/Telestai-Project/lascaux-nodes) with the following format:

   ```json
   {
       "nodeURL": "https://yourdomainhere.com",
       "nodeName": "Your Node Name",
       "nodeImg": "https://yourdomainhere.com/logo.png",
       "nodeWallet": "Your Telestai Wallet Address",
       "nodeDescription": "Optional: A description of your node",
       "status": "public"
   }
   ```

Once approved, your node will appear on the Lascaux frontend.

---

## **Setting Up systemd for Automatic Restarts**

To ensure your node runs continuously, create a `systemd` service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lascaux-node.service
```

Add the following:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Lascaux Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/repository
ExecStart=/usr/bin/make run_app
Restart=on-failure
User=your-username
Group=your-groupname

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable lascaux-node.service
sudo systemctl start lascaux-node.service
```

---

## **Additional Notes**

- **Node Incentives**: Rewards for node operators (e.g., TLS payouts) are planned for future updates.
- **AI Moderation**: Currently handled on the frontend; nodes may assist in future versions.
- **Data Integrity**: Nodes do not sync yet, you are running your own social media database, any information you post on your node is your own.
