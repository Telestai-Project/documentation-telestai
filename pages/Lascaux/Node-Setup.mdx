# **Lascaux Node Setup Guide**

This guide will walk you through setting up a **Lascaux node**, helping decentralize the platform and participate in the testnet. A Lascaux node hosts a **database and API**, making it lightweight and easy to manage. Nodes do **not need to sync** with each other at this time, and they **do not assist with AI moderation yet**, so **high availability is not required**.

---

## **Why Run a Lascaux Node?**

1. **Lightweight Requirements**: A few CPU cores and a few GB of RAM will suffice.
2. **No High Availability Required**: Your node doesn’t need to run 24/7.
3. **Database and API Hosting**: Your node serves local data without syncing with other nodes.
4. **Decentralized Governance**: The system remains operational even if individual nodes go offline.
5. **Contribute to the Testnet**: Your node can be listed on the official Lascaux frontend.

## **Prerequisites**

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Python 3.8+**: Required to run the backend.
- **Nginx**: Optional, for reverse proxy and SSL.
- **Open Ports**:
  - **Port 80**: For HTTP traffic (required by Nginx and Certbot).
  - **Port 443**: For HTTPS traffic (SSL).
- **Router Access**: To set up **port forwarding** if needed.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Telestai-Project/lascaux-backend.git
cd lascaux-backend
git checkout v2.0.0
```

---

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Make sure Python is installed, then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Start the Cassandra Database

Run the Cassandra setup script:

```bash
python start_cassandra.py
```

Wait a few minutes for Cassandra to initialize.

---

### 4. Run the FastAPI Backend

Once Cassandra is up, start the backend using **Uvicorn**:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Your backend will be accessible at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**.

---

## **Setting Up Nginx for Public Access**

To make your node accessible from the internet over **HTTPS**, set up Nginx as a **reverse proxy**.

### Step 1: Install Nginx

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Step 2: Install Certbot for SSL

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Nginx

Create an Nginx configuration file for your domain:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomainhere.com
```

Paste the following content into the file:

```nginx
# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomainhere.com;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

# HTTPS Configuration for Backend
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomainhere.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomainhere.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomainhere.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

---

### Step 4: Enable the Nginx Configuration

Link your configuration to the enabled sites directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomainhere.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

---

### Step 5: Obtain SSL Certificates with Certbot

Ensure **ports 80 and 443** are forwarded to your server. Then, run Certbot:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomainhere.com
```

---

### Step 6: Test and Restart Nginx

```bash
sudo nginx -t  # Check for syntax errors
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Your node will now be accessible at **https://yourdomainhere.com**.

---

## **Port Forwarding**

If your node is hosted behind a router, follow these steps to **forward ports**:

1. Access your router’s admin panel (usually at `192.168.x.x`).
2. Find the **port forwarding** section.
3. Forward **port 80** to the machine running the backend.
4. Forward **port 443** for HTTPS access.

---

## **Get Your Node Listed on the Testnet Frontend**

To list your node on the official frontend at [https://lascaux.telestai.io](https://lascaux.telestai.io):

1. Make sure your node is running and accessible (check with `/healthcheck`).
2. Verify the connection with:
   ```bash
   curl https://yourdomainhere.com/healthcheck
   ```
3. Contact us on **Discord** with your node’s URL, and we’ll add it to the frontend.

---

## **Additional Information**

- **Lightweight Design**: Your node does not need 24/7 availability or high resources.
- **No AI Moderation Yet**: AI moderation is currently handled on the frontend. Nodes will assist with moderation in future updates.
- **Non-Syncing Nodes**: Your node runs independently without needing to sync with other nodes, ensuring data stays intact across the network.

## **Conclusion**

Congratulations! You’ve successfully set up a Lascaux node. Running a node helps decentralize the platform and prepare for future AI-assisted moderation. Thank you for contributing to the Lascaux testnet—your participation strengthens the community.
